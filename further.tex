\section{Structural Induction}
\label{sec:structural}
Structural induction is a proof technique that is used to prove properties of recursively defined objects.
It is a generalization of mathematical induction to objects that have a recursive structure.
The proof is done by induction on the structure of the object.
The base case is proved for the simplest objects, and the induction step is proved for objects that are built from simpler objects.
The proof is complete when all objects are covered by the base case and the induction step.
Structural induction is used in many areas of computer science, including programming language semantics, type theory, and formal verification.
\begin{example}
    In computer science, binary tree can be defined as following language. \\
    \begin{tabular}{rcl}        
    $Tree ::= Empty \mid\ Node\ (value\ Tree\ Tree) $ 
    \end{tabular} \\
    If we want to prove some property of all binary tree, we first prove Empty case, and then, we prove Node (value T1 T2) case with assuming
    T1 and T2 satisfy desired property.
\end{example}
